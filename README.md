This project is an interactive maze game created using Scratch. In this game, you control a robot that must navigate through a maze using the arrow keys. The objective is to guide the robot from the starting point to the goal while avoiding walls and obstacles. The robot detects collisions with the maze walls and reverses direction if it hits them, ensuring it stays inside the maze boundaries. To play, simply use the arrow keys to move the robot through the maze and reach the finish line without touching the walls. Enjoy the challenge!
